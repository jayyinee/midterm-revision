      <h1>Desserts</h1>
        <p>Dessert is anything sweet! I noticed that a lot of the popular desserts in Vietnam are often inspired by another cultural cuisine rather than originated from Vietnam.</p>

            <h1>Xôi Ngũ Sắc</h1>
              <p>Xôi Ngũ Sắc (Ngũ means five and Sắc means color) is made up of 5 different colors of sticky rice to represent the 5 elements Mental (White), Wood (Green), Water (Purple), Fire (Red), and Earth (Yellow). Although I already mentioned the savory sticky rice (Xôi Mặn) in the casual category, there are also sweet sticky rice that are considered as desserts.</p>
              <br>
              <p>How to eat: I think each color of the sticky rice has a different flavor. So if you like all of the flavors, you can put a bit of each flavor onto your plate; if you don’t like all the flavors, you can pick and choose.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Origin: This dish is actually originated from an ethnic group in Vietnam called Tày, who reside in cities like Cao Bằng, Bắc Kạn, Lào Cai, Thái Nguyên (Northern Vietnam).</p>

            <h1>Bánh Bò and Bánh Tiêu</h1>
              <p>Although Bánh Bò (inside) and Bánh Tiêu (outside) are two different desserts, they are often eaten together because their flavors balance each other nicely. Bánh Bò is made from rice flour, water, coconut milk, sugar, and yeast, and has a honeycomb-like appearance on the inside due to the presence of numerous small air bubbles. It has a sweet flavor with chewy, spongy texture. Bánh Tiêu consists of a dough made of flour, salt, and sugar coated with sesame seeds and fried until golden brown. It has a salty flavor and the outside has a more crunchy, paper-like texture.</p>
              <br>
              <p>How to eat: While Bánh Bò can be eaten by itself, Bánh Tiêu is often paired with Bánh Bò rather than eaten by itself. As shown in the picture, Bánh Tiêu acts as a sleeve for Bánh Bò to be put inside. You can take a bite out of them while both desserts can be held together by your hand.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Origin: Both desserts are originated from Southern China</p>

            <h1>Chè Thái</h1>
              <p>Chè is any traditional Vietnamese sweet beverage, dessert soup or stew, or pudding. Chè includes a wide variety of distinct soups or puddings. Varieties of Chè can be made with mung beans, black-eyed peas, kidney beans, tapioca, jelly, fruit, and coconut cream. The main ingredients of Chè Thái are jackfruit, lychees, longan, pandan jelly, and red rubies. Depending on the person, they can add different types of jellies and beans to enhance their Chè Thái.</p>
              <br>
              <p>How to eat: Although Chè Thái is usually served like a cocktail drink in a cup, you usually have to have a spoon to scoop up the fruits, jellies, and beans.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Origin: Thailand (the word “Thái” in “Chè Thái” means Thailand in Vietnamese)</p>

            <h1>Chè Bà Ba</h1>
              <p>Chè Bà Ba is made with a milk soup base and square pieces of taro, cassava and khoai lang bí, a kind of long sweet potato with red skin and yellow flesh. The dish commonly includes pieces of tapioca, and the dish is typically eaten warm, but can also be eaten cold. While Chè Thái and Chè Bà Ba are both in the category of Chè, they are very different from each other; Chè Thái is enjoyed by everyone, Chè Bà Ba is mostly enjoyed by adults and the elderly.</p>
              <br>
              <p>How to eat: Unlike Chè Thái, Chè Bà Ba is usually served in a bowl and eaten with a spoon.</p>
