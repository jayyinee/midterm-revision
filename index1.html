      <h1>Noodles<h1>
        <p>I’d like to think that noodles are the fancy dishes of Vietnamese cuisine as it usually takes a lot of time and effort to cook. My family and I usually only eat noodle dishes once a week (usually on the weekend) or on special occasions (e.g. Lunar New Year). Notably, noodles with the same name can also have different textures and sizes, so visit <a href="https://www.lacademie.com/types-of-vietnamese-noodles/" style="color: black;">this website</a> if you want to learn more about the variations of one noodle type. Sometimes, the noodle itself is its own unique dish, but other times (e.g. Mì Quảng), the name of various noodle dishes comes from only one noodle type (e.g. Bánh Canh). So if you want to refer to a particular dish of a noodle type, you have to also include the main protein ingredient of the dish: chicken, beef, shrimp, etc.</p>

            <h1>Bún Bò Huế</h1>
              <p>Bún Bò Huế is greatly admired for its balance of spicy, sour, salty and sweet flavors and the predominant flavor is that of lemon grass. Compared to phở or bún noodles, the noodles for Bún Bò Huế are thicker and more cylindrical. It includes ingredients such as cubes of congealed pork blood, big pieces of beef and pork bones (oxtail, beef shank, pork neck bones, pork feet, and pork knuckles/ham hocks), and chả lụa (Vietnamese pork bologna).</p>
              <br>
              <p>How to eat: If you want a more spicy and pungent flavor in your noodle, you can add sate chili and shrimp paste. Sliced banana flower is often added as toppings, but it can also be substituted with sliced cabbages.</p>

            <h1>Bánh Canh</h1>
              <p>Bánh canh are thick noodles that can be made from tapioca flour or a mixture of rice and tapioca flour. Because the noodle dish’s name comes from the noodle type itself, the dish doesn’t come with a particular set of ingredients, but it is rather being used as an ingredient in a dish. </p>
              <br>
              <p>How to eat: Bánh canh can be made with any ingredients, but I often see it made with pork bones, seafood, or fishcake.</p>

            <h1>Bún Riêu</h1>
              <p>Bún Riêu is made with rice vermicelli  noodles (thin) and a tomato and crab soup base. There are many varieties of Bún Riêu, most of them are made with crab (bún riêu cua), but some are made with fish (bún riêu cá) or small snails (bún riêu ốc). The stock is made from pork and/or chicken bones. Tomatoes, fried tofu, and sometimes pork blood are added. Then the stock is seasoned with fermented shrimp paste.</p>
              <br>
              <p>How to eat: You can add any fresh veggies and herbs such as bean sprouts, perilla leaves, and mint into Bún Riêu, but I think sliced water spinach is the most common topping for this dish.</p>

            <h1>Mì Quảng</h1>
            <p>Mì Quảng is one of the noodle dishes that have the same name as its noodle type. Mì quảng is a flat and wide rice noodle with a yellow color from the turmeric. Its main ingredients are shrimp, pork, and quail eggs and it is usually topped with peanuts, and toasted sesame rice crackers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>How to eat: Like other noodle dishes, you can top it with various veggies and herbs, but I usually don’t like to add anything because I prefer its original taste. For the toasted sesame rice crackers, you can either break it up and put it in the soup (which can get quite soggy if you forget about it) or you just dip it in the soup and then take a bite out of it.</p>
