      <h1>Casuals</h1>
        <p>Although any Vietnamese food can be considered as casual/street food (even food that was served to royalties in the old days), the dishes I included in this category are often found selling at homemade convenience stores, food cart, and flea markets rather than in a restaurant.</p>

            <h1>Bánh Giò</h1>
              <p>Bánh Giò can be roughly translated into pyramid pork dumpling. The outer layer is made out of rice flour, filled with minced pork, wood ear, mushroom, and quail egg (optional). Although it is called dumpling in English due to how it is structured, it’s very different from dumplings you regularly see as it is much larger in size and it is served in banana leaves.</p>
              <br>
              <p>How to eat: I usually just peel off the banana leaves and just dig in with a spoon, no need to transfer it into a bowl.</p>

            <h1>Cơm Tấm</h1>
              <p>Cơm Tấm is a rice dish made from a type of rice (Tấm) with fractured rice grains that were traditionally chucked away after the milling process, which makes it more unique than the normal, full-sized Jasmine rice we have. Cơm Tấm is accompanied by numerous toppings such as fried eggs, steamed omelet with meat loaf, shredded pork skin, grilled pork chops, or deep-fried fish patties. The usual garnishes include lime wedges, and chopped spring onions, while accompaniments served on the side include sliced tomatoes and cucumbers, pickled vegetables, or fish sauce.</p>
              <br>
              <p>How to eat: Because the rice grains are broken, they have a drier texture than normal rice, so we usually put fish sauce on it to make it more moist to chew.</p>

            <h1>Xội Mặn</h1>
              <p>Xội Mặn is a type of sticky rice (xôi) dishes that has a salty and savory flavor. It is usually topped with Chinese sausage, thinly chopped Vietnamese pork bologna, pork floss (rousong), quail egg, scallion and oil garnish, and soy sauce.</p>
              <br>
              <p>How to eat: You can add more soy sauce if you want your xôi mặn to be more salty. Even though the rice is stick, which many people think would be easier to grab with chopsticks, it is actually easier to eat with a spoon as it will be easier to separate the chunks of rice.</p>

            <h1>Bánh Bèo</h1>
              <p>Bánh Bèo is made from a combination of rice flour and tapioca flour. The English translation for this dish is water fern cakes. It is merely a thin steamed rice cake with its top stuffed with minced shrimp mingled with scallions, green bean paste, and crispy fried shallots. I would say that bánh bèo is one of the many dishes that are considered as true street food as it is usually sold by ladies who would carry on their shoulder a wooden pole with extra large hand-woven rattan bamboo baskets on each end of the pole.</p>
              <br>
              <p>How to eat: It is usually served in a very small bowl so you just pour a small amount of fish sauce into the bowl and dig in with a spoon.</p>
